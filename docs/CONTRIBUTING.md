# Contributing to AHS|ACES

To start programming Aces, clone this repository and open it with the code editor of your choice.

You will have to build the project for any JavaScript or CSS changes to take effect. To do so, go to the Aces directory in your shell and type `make`. To setup a local hosting server, type `make host`. To deploy to a Firebase Hosting server, you need to get the Firebase node package (`npm install --global firebase-tools && firebase login`) and edit `.firebaserc` to the appropriate configuration.

## Rules

- Please follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

- Using tabs for indentation is preferred, but whatever floats your boat.
- Do not track user data except for logging the authors of database write requests.
