# Contributing to AHS|ACES

To start programming ACES, clone this repository and open it with the code editor of your choice.

You will have to build the project for any JavaScript or CSS changes to take effect. If you have a Bash shell (Linux/Mac/WSL), you can run `sh build.sh` at the root project directory. If you cannot build locally, push your changes to the remote repository and GitHub Actions will auto-build it.

## Rules

- Please follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- To ensure anyone can be a content editor, regardless of whether they have disabilities such as visual impairments, make sure the editor adheres to most, if not all, of the [WCAG 2.0 accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-WCAG20-20060427/appendixB.html).
- Using tabs for indentation is preferred, but whatever floats your boat.
- Do not track user data except for logging the authors of database write requests.
